# How to Generate Your PDF Resume

I have generated a professional, ATS-optimized resume for you in HTML format: `resume.html`.

## best Method: Print to PDF (Recommended)

For the absolute best results (perfect formatting, clickable links, high resolution):

1.  Open `resume.html` in your web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge).
2.  Press `Cmd + P` (or go to File > Print).
3.  In the Destination dropdown, select **"Save as PDF"**.
4.  Ensure **"Background graphics"** is checked (if available under More Settings) to see the subtle design elements.
5.  Click **Save**.

This method guarantees that what you see is exactly what you get, and modern browsers serve as excellent PDF generators.

## Alternative: Auto-generated PDF

I have also attempted to auto-generate `resume.pdf` for you using system tools. You can check that file directly. If the formatting is slightly off (which can happen with automated CLI tools), please use the "Print to PDF" method above.
