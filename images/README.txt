Add the following image files to this folder:

1. profile.jpg or profile.jpeg - Your profile photo (ideal size: 500x500px)
2. trading.jpg - Image for the LLM Trading Model project
3. medical.jpg - Image for the Disease Prediction Model project
4. kubernetes.jpg - Image for the Kubernetes project
5. docker.jpg - Image for the Docker project

You can change these files according to your preference, but maintain the file names and format (JPG/JPEG).

If you change the file names, you will need to update the corresponding file paths in the index.html file.

Note: The website is configured to use profile.jpeg first, and if not found, it will try to use profile.jpg. For project images, if the original images are not found, placeholder images will be displayed.
